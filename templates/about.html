  <h1 class="about heading">How I got here</h1>
</header>
<p class="About_Story">I've spent the past 17 years as a medical imaging technologist.It has been 
  great for many reasons, providing care to those in need topping the list. I am very ambitious 
  and driven which has taken me far in this field. In management roles I've had the privelege of 
  "being the change" and enhancing the patient care experience. I also helped improve the job ex-
  perience for those I've managed and mentored. After some time, I realized that I had skills that
  were valuable, but in my <em>role</em> weren't typically useful; High attention to detail, being 
  highly proactive in problem solving and process improvement. These traits, coupled with a desire 
  to get involved with the most advanced technology on the globe have landed me here: Software Eng-
  ineering, Cloud Engineering, Data Engineering. I'm interested in all of it. So, I've spent the 
  last two years on a quest to become an engineer and use the tenacity that drives 
  me to make a big impact in tech! 
  What can I engineer for you?</p>
