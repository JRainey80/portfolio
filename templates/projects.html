    Creating this website has been a fulfilling journey of learning.
    It began with enhancing my Python skills, adopting Flask for its
    suitability for simple, static sites, and polishing my CSS and
    HTML knowledge for better visual appeal. I managed the code across
    Linux and Windows devices and host the site on Azure Web Apps in a
    Docker container. A CI/CD pipeline, triggered on push to the main
    branch, pushes the new image to Docker Registry, and then deploys to Azure.

  Created a fully automated, serverless resume site hosted on Azure Blob 
  Storage. The site features a real-time visit counter powered by an Azure 
  Function App and CosmosDB Table, with all infrastructure managed using 
  Terraform. CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions ensure seamless updates for 
  both the frontend and backend. This project demonstrates advanced use of 
  cloud services and DevOps tools for scalable and efficient deployment.
