      Building this website has been an incredibly rewarding learning
      experience. I started by deepening my understanding of Python, going
      beyond what I learned in school to get a real grasp on control flow logic
      and refining my syntax. After that, I chose to learn Flask because it
      seemed like the right fit for creating a straightforward, static site with
      just the basics on the backend. Once I felt comfortable with Flask, I
      moved on to brush up on my CSS and HTML skills to get the website looking
      just right. To keep my work organized across my Linux VM and Windows PC, I
      set up GitHub for effective code management. Throughout this project, I
      turned to various resources like Google, YouTube, and ChatGPT for
      guidance, piecing everything together and really enjoying the process. The
      goal wasn't just to have a website to show off my projects and personal
      brand; I also wanted to lay a strong foundation for future developments.
      I'm looking forward to taking on new challenges, such as dockerizing the
      website, hosting it on Azure, implementing CI/CD pipelines, managing logs,
      and automating everything with Terraform.
