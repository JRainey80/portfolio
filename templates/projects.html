    Creating this website has been a fulfilling journey of learning.
    It began with enhancing my Python skills, adopting Flask for its
    suitability for simple, static sites, and polishing my CSS and
    HTML knowledge for better visual appeal. I managed the code across
    Linux and Windows devices and host the site on Azure Web Apps in a
    Docker container. A CI/CD pipeline, triggered on push to the main
    branch, pushes the new image to Docker Registry, and then deploys to Azure.

  My resume hosted on Azure blob storage as a static site. The front end is a
  simple HTML/CSS version of my resume. JavaScript provides an interactive visitor
  counter. The backend consists of a Python script working as an API via an Azure Function
  App. A CosmosDB Table keeps the visitor count. Front/Back ends have git repos with
  respective Github Actions pipelines for deployment. All resources are configured and
  managed with Terraform
