      <p>Creating this site has been a rewarding experience. I began by first, 
        learning Python. I had covered many fundamentals in school, but I 
        needed repetition at working through control flow logic and syntax 
        refinement. I moved on to learning flask since it seemed fitting for
        a basic, static site with minimal back end functionality. After a solid 
        flask course, I spent some time with CSS and HTML fundamentals and then 
        dove right in! I set up GitHub to manage code between my two devices; a
        Linux vm and a Windows pc. Consulting the courses I learned from, Google,
        Youtube, and ChatGPT; I put it all together and really had fun. Besides
        needing a site to showcase my projects and brand, I wanted something 
        tangeable to support for the next projects: Dockerizing the site, hosting 
        it on Azure, implementing CI/CD, log management, and coding it all in Terraform.
