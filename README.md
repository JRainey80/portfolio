# This is a personal portfolio website that I coded with HTML/CSS/Javascript/Python. I used the Flask framework and it contains AI created images, a spinning photo carousel, page select buttons and a hamburger menu. I containerized with Docker and have GH Actions CI/CD for deployment. It's hosted with the Azure Web Apps service which provides security and CDN speed/distribution. Still a bit slow to load, but on the cheaper plan, it works!
